# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some formatting on my Free Code Camp Quote Generator.

**Thoughts** I'm having issues with my AJAX running on Chrome and when pushed to github pages. When running it locally on safari, I don't seem to have issues. Since I haven't learned AJAX in my coding bootcamp, I have some digging to do. I feel good about the HTML/CSS progress I've made so far.

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated buttons and shadowing Free Code Camp Quote Generator.

**Thoughts** I finished some of the last touches included button effects and shadowing. I pushed my page to github pages but need to research the security error "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated sources."
