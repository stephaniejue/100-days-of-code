# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, January 3,2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some formatting on my Free Code Camp Quote Generator.

**Thoughts** I'm having issues with my AJAX running on Chrome and when pushed to github pages. When running it locally on safari, I don't seem to have issues. Since I haven't learned AJAX in my coding bootcamp, I have some digging to do. I feel good about the HTML/CSS progress I've made so far.

**Link(s) to work**: [Quote Generator](https://github.com/stephaniejue/quote_generator_ajax)
