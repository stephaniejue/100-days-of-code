# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some formatting on my Free Code Camp Quote Generator.

**Thoughts** I'm having issues with my AJAX running on Chrome and when pushed to github pages. When running it locally on safari, I don't seem to have issues. Since I haven't learned AJAX in my coding bootcamp, I have some digging to do. I feel good about the HTML/CSS progress I've made so far.

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated buttons and shadowing Free Code Camp Quote Machine.

**Thoughts** I finished some of the last touches included button effects and shadowing. Its baffling how long little things take and how much back and forth happens, but I'm getting closer to a look I like. I pushed my page to github pages but need to research the security error "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated sources." Still have some learning to do around AJAX, but I'm happy to have a working version on codepen and github pages!
