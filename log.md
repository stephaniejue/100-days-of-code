# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some formatting on my Free Code Camp Quote Generator.

**Thoughts** I'm having issues with my AJAX running on Chrome and when pushed to github pages. When running it locally on safari, I don't seem to have issues. Since I haven't learned AJAX in my coding bootcamp, I have some digging to do. I feel good about the HTML/CSS progress I've made so far.

### Day 2: Wednesday, January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated buttons and shadowing Free Code Camp Quote Machine.

**Thoughts** I finished some of the last touches included button effects and shadowing. Its baffling how long little things take and how much back and forth happens, but I'm getting closer to a look I like. I pushed my page to github pages but need to research the security error "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated sources." Still have some learning to do around AJAX, but I'm happy to have a working version on codepen and github pages!

### Day 3: Thursday, January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on address book app inheritance.

**Thoughts** Today was frustrating trying to figure out why my application.html.erb file wasn't being rendered for my other views. Because application.html.erb has my page headers, bootstrap also wasn't loading. After spending some time checking my file paths, I chose to do a workaround I found on stackoverflow. I created a partial html_header.html.erb and moved all of my header info to there, then added <%= render 'layouts/html_header' %> to each page. Seems to work for now. I'll get started with bootstrap tomorrow!

### Day 4: Friday, January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a wildlife app at LEARN academy and continued working on it after school.

**Thoughts** Created a rails app using scaffolding today and learend about AJAX and JSON. The app has a relational database and functionality to add/remove sightings to animals using AJAX. This took most of the day and the bones of it I worked on with my pair programmer. After class I continuted cleaning up some of the code and adding in some formatting, including bootstrap. Unlike my Address Book App (above), the application.html.erb file IS working and I'm having a much more succesful time messing with the look of the application. I'd like to add more functionality tomorrow.

### Day 5: Saturday, January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a weather app with basic API call and AJAX/jQuery functionality

**Thoughts** Today I started on a new app as part of FCC's projects. I'm pretty happy with the basic functionality I have so far. I was able to pull geolocator info usina an API and include that in an API call to OpenWeatherMap for weather information. I ran into a few bumps, including forgetting to add the jQuery CDN (oops!) but I'm happy that I was able to figure out most of the functionality that I'll need for the app. Next up I'll fine tune the display, including what type of info is provided to the user.

### Day 6: Sunday, January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my weather app

**Thoughts** After creating the API request yesterday I worked on formatting the data today. I created 2 functions to convert kelvin (the default temp returned) into farenheit and celsius. I added sunrise and sunset times and converted those times from unix to javascript local time format. I also added a weather icons library and table to ogranize all weather elements.

### Day 7: Monday, January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my weather app

**Thoughts** Had to create a workaround because geolocator api was returning a 403 error. Used $.getJSON("http://ipinfo.io"..) instead, which is working pretty well (and in codepen!). Created function to change time icon depending on local time of user. Need to do some cleanup with my js file and figure out the 403 errors. Might look in to google's geo api instead. Still happy about my progress, not feeling as lost as I thought I would with triaging AJAX/API errors.

### Day 8: Tuesday, January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my weather app

**Thoughts** Added jquery on click functionality to swtich from F to C temp. Had to work around using jquery after an AJAX call. Also fixed time icons to account for double digit hours.

### Day 9: Wednesday, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added toggle button and button.js to my weather app

**Thoughts** Added a toggle button to switch temps for a more visual effect. For some reason code isnt working the same on codepen or github pages as it is locally, something to triage more tomorrow.

### Day 10: Thursday, January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC weather app and 10% done with the challenge!

**Thoughts** Put the finishing touches on my weather app today. I added background images that change for night vs day, I'll have to check tomorrow morning if its working correctly. In the future, I may play around with some additional background images based on the weather condition, but I need to move on for now. I set a goal to finish this by end of week and told myself I would get as close to "perfect" as possible. Yesterday I was feeling a frustrated for getting carried away with the design aspects of this app, but I'm happy how it turned out. Trying not to get caught up in the little things going forward. Up tomorrow (and this weekend): finishing my portfolio.

### Day 11: Friday, January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting/Restarting my portfolio

**Thoughts** I'm setting a goal to have the majority of the layout/template figured out this weekend. I just started playing around with some templates and am trying to figure out what pieces I'd like to combine. Long way to go, but need to get this done.

### Day 12: Saturday, January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lots of work done on my portfolio

**Thoughts** I finally settled on a good template that feels like me. I got some of the basic content updated and a few changes to the formatting. I want to add in some animation with JavaScript/Jquery tomorrow. I cleared out in-progress content enough so that I can start sending this out. Also, need to add email functionality. Really happy with my progress! At least I have something to show for interviews now.

### Day 13: Sunday, January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with my portfolio!!

**Thoughts** I still have a few things I want to add to and finish, but I have a working portfolio! and I got it up and running with my domain name. So excited to share this after two full days of work this weekend. Not going to spend too much time reflect, already committed to git a lot today, that counts.

### Day 14: Monday, January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much to report, but worked on my portfolio a little

**Thoughts** Trying to figure out the contact form for my portfolio, then realized I need to figure out PHP for Heroku for the tutorial I'm doing. So spent some time installing and configuring... going to work on it more tomorrow.

### Day 15: Tuesday, January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still fighting with my contact form

**Thoughts** Got my static site up on heroku with contact_me.php, but it's still not working. It's giving me a success alert, which is the frustrating part. I downloaded MAMP to try and figure this out on a local server, but still no luck. Digging continues tomorrow.

### Day 16: Tuesday, January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Group projects! Working on VolunteerUP!

**Thoughts** Today we started working on our group projects at LEARN. After class, I added some styling/formatting changes to feel more like a real application. Will be putting in lots of work on this in the next two weeks. Excited to see what we can make!

### Day 17: Tuesday, January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Group projects continued

**Thoughts** We're making tons of progress which is great! We already have a lot of the basic functionality in place. Spent some time fixing tests and merge conflicts. Also got to work on some fuzzy searches. The searches aren't perfect because of postgres's pg_trgm similary threshold. Will try to figure that out tomorrow.
